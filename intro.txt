Hello sir,

My name is Omkar Dipakkumar Patange, and I'm from satara. 
In my free time, I enjoy playing cricket, badminton, watching movies, 
spending time with family and friends & travelling.

In the next five years, I hope to either get into the government sector or join a product-based company as a software developer. 
I'm also planning to appear for the upcoming GATE 2025 examination.
I'll do my best to achieve my goals.
